00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.120
<Lanzo Kruger> Hello, customer service? I need to inquire about an order.

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:03.980
<Customer Service> Sure, how can I assist you today?

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.420
<Lanzo Kruger> I placed an order a few weeks ago, item 1968-S, and it still hasn't arrived.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.760
<Customer Service> Let me check on that for you. Can I have your order number?

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.880
<Lanzo Kruger> Yes, it's order number 123456789.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.440
<Customer Service> Thank you. Please hold on for a moment while I look into this.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.600
<Lanzo Kruger> Alright, but I hope this gets resolved quickly.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.920
<Customer Service> I understand, we'll do our best to assist you.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.280
<Customer Service> It seems there was a delay with the shipment of item 1968-S.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.640
<Customer Service> It should arrive within the next few days.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.080
<Lanzo Kruger> A delay? I really needed that item by now.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.440
<Lanzo Kruger> This is quite frustrating.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.760
<Customer Service> I apologize for the inconvenience, Mr. Kruger.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.320
<Customer Service> Is there anything else I can assist you with?

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.520
<Lanzo Kruger> No, I suppose not. Thank you for your help.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.400
<Customer Service> You're welcome. Have a good day.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.560
<Lanzo Kruger> You too. Goodbye.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.000
<Customer Service> Goodbye.
