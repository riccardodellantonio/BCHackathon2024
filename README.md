## Introduction

This project, developed during the Microsoft AI Business Central Hackathon 2024, focuses on leveraging AI within Business Central. Our goal is to enhance sales processes by providing AI-driven solutions. The applications assist in suggesting items that align with customer preferences, facilitate effective email communication, and streamline meeting management by analyzing and summarizing transcripts. The AI autonomously identifies customers from transcripts, offering users convenient selections.
For every solution, a short video is provided. In addition there is also a screenshot of a setup needed for the BossCockpit1 

## BossCockpit1 - Meeting Analyzer

BossCockpit1 is an application that analyzes Teams meeting transcripts within Business Central. It identifies customers discussed in the meeting, checks for existing customer records, and summarizes the meeting details. The summary is then linked to the corresponding contact in the activity protocol.

### Key Features:

- Transcript Analysis: The application intelligently analyzes Teams meeting transcripts to identify key customer-related details.
- Customer Check: BossCockpit1 cross-references the extracted information with existing customer records to check for duplicates or updates.
- Meeting Summaries: Summarizes the discussions held during the meeting and stores them in the corresponding contact's activity documents in Business Central.

## BossCockpit2 - Sales Quote Email Proposal Generator

BossCockpit2 extends the sales quote analysis capability to include the generation of email proposals. Similar to BossCockpit3, it suggests new items based on the current list, but it goes a step further by drafting an email proposal to send to the customer.

### Key Features:

- Sales Quote Analysis: Similar to BossCockpit3, BossCockpit2 analyzes sales quotes to understand the current list of items.
- Item Suggestions: Suggests new items that align with the existing list, optimizing the sales offering.
- Email Drafting: Uniquely, BossCockpit2 goes a step further by autonomously drafting persuasive emails to propose the newly suggested items to the customer.

## BossCockpit3 - Sales Quote Analyzer & Item Recommender

BossCockpit3 focuses on analyzing sales quotes in Business Central. It suggests new items that complement the current list, allowing end users to select and add items to the list. This app is designed to enhance the sales quoting process.

### Key Features:

- Sales Quote Analysis: BossCockpit3 analyzes existing sales quotes to understand the context and current list of items.
- Item Suggestions: The application suggests new items that complement the existing list, aiming to enhance the sales offering.
